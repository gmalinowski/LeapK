# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses semantic versioning.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-10-19

### Changed

- Simplified popup handling: the active-window outline is temporarily hidden
  whenever KWin reports a visible context menu, submenu, dropdown, combo-box
  popup, tooltip, or Plasma panel popup. It returns when the popup closes.
- Removed the experimental composite outline around application menus because
  toolkit surface geometry could still leave the window outline above them.
- The installer now builds in a temporary directory and cleans it on exit, so
  installing the effect no longer leaves binaries inside the source tree.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-10-19

### Fixed

- Restored the generated Qt plugin metadata includes after the source files
  were renamed for the public repository. Without them, version 1.1.4 built
  successfully but KWin could not discover either plugin.
- The installer now validates the compiled KWin plugin ID and version before
  replacing an installed copy.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-10-19

### Fixed

- Context menus and nested submenus belonging to the active window are now
  included in the outlined shape. Overlapping outline segments are clipped so
  the border follows the exposed popup edges instead of crossing popup content.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- Display the installed version in the graphical configuration window.
- Display the version at the beginning and end of installation.
- Add a top-level `VERSION` file as the canonical project version for builds
  and scripts.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-10-19

### Fixed

- Suppress the outline while application dropdown menus, context menus,
  combo-box popups, tooltips, or Plasma panel popups are visible, preventing
  the screen-level outline from being painted above popup content.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- Automatic `kwinrc` monitoring as a fallback when KWin does not deliver a reconfiguration request.
- Runtime diagnostics for the loaded width, offset, radius, and placement mode.
- Update detection and an explicit logout notice in the installer.
- Uninstallation script.

### Changed

- Renamed the user-facing “Outline gap” setting to “Outline offset”.
- Existing settings are preserved when reinstalling or updating.
- The old effect is unloaded before its binary is replaced.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- Configurable outline offset from 0 to 30 pixels.
- Inside and outside offset rendering.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- Active-window tracking through KWin.
- Theme-independent OpenGL outline rendering.
- Plasma accent color and custom color support.
- Configurable outline width and corner radius.
- Graphical configuration module for Desktop Effects.
